The books are worst because they could not serve the purpose of my study. My purpose of buying a book is to get problems that I can solve. I want a learning material that takes me step by step while challenging me. If the material doesn't fall under that, it didn't serve my purpose and thus it is a bad book that I own.

Return policy isn't as exciting in Nepal.


### Computer organization and Architecture 
- V.Rajaraman, T.Radhakrishnan

### Data Structures
- Lipschutz

While this book has exercises/problems, it's totally out of place. It doesn't help you to learn what it intends to teach.

### Data Structures and Program Design
- Robert L. Kruse

This one I got for cheap so I don't regret it as much as others.

### Microelectronic Circuits
- Sedra, Smith

This is a great book on all aspects. But I regret buying this because I totally lost my interest to learn this subject.


### TCP/IP Protocol Suite
- Fourouzan

This book sucks to its core. It suffers from similar problems as above. It's not very practical book.


### Data Communication & Networking
- Fourozan

As I moved more towards science of computers rather than engineering, this book has lost its essence in my book rack.


### Cryptography And Network Security
- Atul Kahate

Most books I mentioned above have been written by top professors. This book is genuinely worst book. It has no depth, no anything. It's good for passing exams only. But I purchased it after I had graduated only. So, no point of it to me.


### Operating Systems
- Atul Kahate, Achyut S. Godbole

Same issue as earlier book by the same author.


### Operating Systems
- Deitel

This book is a failed attempt on teaching Operating Systems. It has zero exercises lol. And it tries to oversimplify concepts through diagrams. But it fails miserably on it.


I have strong opinions on these books. I've bought 6 books on same subject(DBMS) and I don't regret purchasing any of them(so far!). I've got 3 books on distributed system and system design and I am buying even more of that soon.


### GATE CSE PYQs
- Khanna Publishers

This book is useless and costed too much money. I had purchased Engineering License Book for NEC as well and I regret buying both of them equally.


### UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook
- Evi Nemeth et al

This is a great classic to have on your book rack. However, it lacks depth. As the name says it's "handbook". And I am that kind of person who prefers to read something that solves a specific problem rather than going all over the place. "Jack of all trades" isn't what I seek in a book. I would rather surf internet to learn that.



PS: These books are worst for my use case. For someone in different situation unlike me, these books can be a goldmine. If you want to purchase these books, shoot me up a DM on linkedin.

## Gigs

Gig economy is the most proven and reliable way to earn income using the world wide web in Nepal or anywhere else in the world. Fiverr is one of the most recommended sites for online gig economy. It is because fiverr is very popular among employers in the gig economy world. Consequently leading to many jobs there. Likewise a huge competition among gig workers.

I agree that fiverr can get somewhat annoying to use as a freelancer sometimes. They have a tiresome and unpredictable verification process. You never know when your account will freeze. And it sucks when it you are a victim of such false positives.

But that is just the outcome of having a monopoly in a field. And I strongly believe fiverr is still the most recommended way to get started in online gig economy.

## Content creation 

Content creation opens up window of opportunities. Content can be created and monetized in any platforms. But I will discuss about youtube and website.

The easiest way to own a website is via mercantile, cloudflare and github pages. 

Here is how the entire thing works:

- You request bijanaryal.com.np on browser.
- The request goes to a local dns resolver.
- Assume the LDNS resolver has not cached the domain to ip mapping.
- The request goes to recursive dns server.
- Recursive dns server queries the root nameserver for the ip of bijanaryal.com.np domain.
- Root nameserver responds with ip of .com.np domain's nameserver.
- Recursive dns server queries the .com.np domain's namserver for the ip of bijanaryal.com.np domain.
- .com.np domain's nameserver responds with the ip of bijanaryal.com.np's nameserver. Which in my case is xyz.ns.cloudflare.com.
- Now recursive dns server queries the xyz.ns.cloudflare.com for the ip address of bijanaryal.com.np.
- Thus in cloudflare we need to address this issue. We do it by adding DNS records. "A" and "CNAME" records to be precise. We put those dns records in our cloudflare account i.e. the our dns server. All it does is to basically redirect request to github pages.

For more details on how to do this, read this blog: https://sudeepacharya.com.np/blog/2020/05/05/free-com-np-domain-free-hosting/

Free domain and github pages hosting works for most blog sites. But you might be someone who do not like to publish with your real name embedded on your domain.  In that case, I recommend that you register a domain from [stablecluster](https://manage.stablecluster.com/aff.php?aff=22).

Stablecluster is a Nepali startup. They accept Nepali bank payment as of writing this article. This is good news specially if you do not have a dollar card. You can also purchase web hosting from them. They have a [wordpress hosting plan](https://stablecluster.com/wordpress-hosting#choose-your-plan).

Another medium for content creation is using videos. You can publish videos on YouTube.

In both YouTube and personal website, there are various ways to earn income:

- Google Adsense, Journey by MediaVine

- Affiliate marketing

- Selling digital products

- Selling guest posts


Selling digital products requires deep expertise unless you are spamming AI fluff.




















You might be wondering how to receive payments in Nepal while working online. In my honest opinion, wire transfer is still the best way. But many small businesses might not support wire transfer. Thus if you want to increase your opportunities in receiving payments, it is good to have a USD account via payoneer.

## Gigs

Gig economy is the most proven and reliable way to earn income using the world wide web in Nepal or anywhere else in the world. Fiverr is one of the most recommended sites for online gig economy.

- Recursive dns server queries the np domain's namserver for the ip of bijanaryal.com.np domain.
- np domain's nameserver responds with the ip of com.np domain's nameserver.
- Recursive dns server queries the com.np domain's nameserver for the ip of bijanaryal.com.np domain.
- .com.np domain's nameserver responds with the ip of bijanaryal.com.np's nameserver. Which in my case is xyz.ns.cloudflare.com.
- Now recursive dns server queries the xyz.ns.cloudflare.com for the ip address of bijanaryal.com.np.
- Thus in cloudflare we need to address this issue. We do it by adding DNS records. "A" records to be precise. We 



























You might be wondering how to receive payments in Nepal while working online. In my honest opinion, wire transfer is still the best way. But many small businesses might not support wire transfer. Thus if you want to increase your opportunities in receiving payments, it is good to have a USD account via payoneer.

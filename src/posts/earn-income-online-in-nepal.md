## Gigs

Gig economy is the most proven and reliable way to earn income using the world wide web in Nepal or anywhere else in the world. Fiverr is one of the most recommended sites for online gig economy. It is because fiverr is very popular among employers in the gig economy world. Consequently leading to many jobs there. Likewise a huge competition among gig workers.

I agree that fiverr can get somewhat annoying to use as a freelancer sometimes. They have a tiresome and unpredictable verification process. You never know when your account will freeze. And it sucks when it you are a victim of such false positives.

But that is just the outcome of having a monopoly in a field. And I strongly believe fiverr is still the most recommended way to get started in online gig economy.

## Content creation 

Content creation opens up window of opportunities. Content can be created and monetized in any platforms. But I will discuss about youtube and website.

For owning a free domain with hosting, read this blog: https://sudeepacharya.com.np/blog/2020/05/05/free-com-np-domain-free-hosting/.

Free domain and github pages hosting works for most blog sites. But you might be someone who do not like to publish with your real name embedded on domain.  In that case, I recommend that you register a domain from [stablecluster](https://manage.stablecluster.com/aff.php?aff=22).

Stablecluster is a Nepali startup. They accept Nepali banks as payment method as of writing this article. This is good news specially if you do not have a dollar card. You can also purchase web hosting from them. They have a [wordpress hosting plan](https://stablecluster.com/wordpress-hosting#choose-your-plan) that starts at a very affordable rate.

Another medium for content creation is using videos. You can publish videos on YouTube.

Growing on youtube can be sometimes be tricky. If you are looking for AI assisted mentorship for growing on youtube, [vidiq](https://vidiq.com/refnp) can help.

In both YouTube and personal website, there are various ways to earn income:

- Google Adsense
- Journey by MediaVine
- Affiliate marketing
- Selling digital products
- Selling guest posts

Selling guest posts is an interesting way to generate revenue. It gets dirty at times due to people flooding sites with spammy guest posts. So do it with caution. It is guaranteed and easiest way to generate income but your blog might get penalized by Google. To sell guest posts, join [collaborator.pro](https://collaborator.pro/signup?ref=SS7XVA). You will need some google indexed posts in order to get approved by the platform.

## Stock photography/video

In this method, you earn by royalty. i.e. You capture pictures. Put it up for review in stock photo websites, once approved, you earn royalty for life. Some pay you per download, whereas some pay per purchase. Some of the popular sites for selling stock photos are shutterstock, 500px etc.

## App development

Make apps. And deliver them at a SaaS model. i.e. customer pays monthly fee for using the app. This works specially well for iOS apps. Since iOS users are more likely to pay for an application compared to android users. This is a good way specially if you are already in the field of computer science. Learn app development. If you want to learn app development, there is no better platform than  [Udemy](https://trk.udemy.com/BnmL4B). Click the link and start learning immediately. 

## Online teaching
You can teach on  [Udemy](https://trk.udemy.com/BnmL4B), skillshare etc. 

## Freelancing

Many might consider freelancing and gig economy similar. But it is actually different. Freelancing is usually for longer duration than gig work. Upwork is the best platform out there. 


## Remote work

Another option to make income online is by doing remote jobs. The jobs can be full time, part-time. They are usually contract based. To search for remote jobs, linkedin is still the best platform. Another way is to visit producthunt and search for startups that you would want to work for. Visit their career pages and apply for a role you fit. Getting a remote job is difficult(to be honest, getting any job is difficult). If you want to improve your chances, you can do so by using ai resume builder websites. They make your resume HR friendly. Some even provide potential interview questions. Of course you could do this in chatgpt itself. But resume websites are trained specially on resume data. So they might be more reliable and accurate.


You might be wondering how to receive payments in Nepal while working online. In my honest opinion, wire transfer is still the best way. But many small businesses worldwide might not support wire transfer. Thus if you want to increase your opportunities in receiving payments, it is good to have a USD account via payoneer.

Caution:

Lots of scams ongoing in "make money online" videos in YouTube nepal. There is no easy money. You earn money by spending your time, using your skills etc. Anyone claiming that you can earn by watching ad videos or playing games is trying to fool you.

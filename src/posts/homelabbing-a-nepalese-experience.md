I ran a google search query for "homelabbing in Nepal". Besides some reddit posts, I could not find a blog. So why not write one? The Nepalese audience might be a small one but it is definitely worth serving for.

Beginners might be interested in learning what is a homelab, why start a homelab etc. I will write about them as Appendix.

# Why I want to homelab?

Most people have illusion that they might get hired in Nepalese job market if they homelab. I am not illusioned about that. Nepalese job market is all about "who you know" rather than "what you know". And it does not matter how much you know about anything until and unless you know someone.

I find deploying servers, writing deployment guide about them fun. I want to learn containerization skills. And I want to simulate servers and clusters in production that I have been pushing away claiming that I do not have a powerful enough machine.


# The computer

The second hand electronics market is really bad in Kathmandu Valley(based on the information available at facebook marketplace and hamrobazaar). Nepalese people have no idea how much electronics depreciate over time. They want their original buying price while selling their used electronics. I have not gone to look after offline market. I have observed the offline sellers are overconscious about selling second hand electronics. They are over careful about not making an impression that they might exchange used parts if you go there to repair your new computer.

I will be going with this computer setup.

AMD Ryzen 7 5700G Processor (1 Year Warranty)

Gigabyte A520M K DDR4 Motherboard (3 Year Warranty)

Transcend 32GB 3200Mhz DDR4 RAM (5 Year Warranty)

Micron 512GB NVMe SSD (1 Year Warranty)

White RGB Gaming Case with 550W PSU (3 Year Warranty)

Cooler Master Z50 Air Cooler (3 Year Warranty)

White glass case with 3 fans

550w 80+ Bronze PSU 

Radeon Integrated Graphics

Windows 11 Pro OS


The total cost of this is quoted to be Rs.49,000 from a local seller. I think it is an excellent deal. However I will be cross checking at couple of other shops before making the final decision.


# The services

We got to the most important part of homelab. The services that will run on them. I do not plan to run services 24 x 7. The services that I plan to deploy and use are:

- firewall

- containerization platform

- container orchestration platform

- logs shipping and visualization platform

The host operating system will be windows 11. I will be using virtualbox for virtualization. The guest OS of choice is rocky linux latest onwards minimal distro.

I learnt computer networks last month and I wanted to share my thoughts on how I would learn it if I could start over.

Computer networks is one of the most important computer science subject. It finds its applications on network, devops engineering to software engineering. Our current age is filled with the applications of computer networks. And it cannot be avoided.

I assume the audience reading this content is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computers in some university.

Computer networks is a vast field, so it is a genuine concern of most people about what topics to focus on. For that purpose, you can pick your university computer networks syllabus and start researching those topics on textbooks [Here's](https://ioesyllabus.blogspot.com/2013/02/computer-network-syllabus-marking.html) the one from Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering.
You can do exercises to enforce the concepts. However, I didn't do it as I approached it from more of an engineering perspective(Whatever that means, hope you get it.).

I urge learners to study from a single accredited source initially. Then think hard on the concept. Preferably without digital distractions. Don't multitask while learning. After you spend some time thinking on your own, now it is the perfect time to go back to multiple textbooks or any credible sources. This is a good way to reduce your frustrations while learning.

Don't forget to revise once a chapter is completed. It's crucial to be proficient in writing exams or attending interviews.

After completing fundamental studies on computer network, one might be interested to dive deeper. If you are among such persons, here are some topics that you could dive into:
- Vendor specific router configurations

- Vendor specific firewall configurations. Palo Alto, Check Point are some commonly used firewalls in Kathmandu, Nepal.

- Distributed systems. Because network fundamentals are utilized to build distributed systems.

- Any application layer protocol of your choice and start digging deeper. Pick SSH. Learn to configure it on Linux. Learn how SSH key based authentication is secure. Pick OpenSSL. Pick DNS. Configure BIND DNS server. Maybe even self-host an email server :).

- Cryptography

- Network security

Book that I recommend

I studied computer networks from Kurose, Ross Computer Networking: A top-down approach. And I highly recommend it. It is a very well written, beginner-friendly textbook.

Books that I have on my shelf, haven't read end to end but recommend

Internetworking with TCP/IP Book by Douglas Comer

# Linux & DevOps Technical Content Writer for Hire | Real Systems Experience

Looking for a technical content writer who actually knows what `systemctl restart nginx` does? I'm Bijan, a technical content writer based in Nepal with 2+ years of hands-on experience as an Associate Support Engineer at a fintech company.

## Why Experience Matters in Technical Writing

The difference between reading documentation written by someone who Googled "Docker basics" versus someone who's debugged production container issues at 2 AM is night and day. I write technical content that's accurate, practical, and actually helps your users because I work with these systems every single day.

- SSL/TLS certificate management
- Reverse proxy configurations

### Troubleshooting & Debugging Articles

## Why Clients Choose Me

I've managed Linux servers in production environments, handled incidents, and debugged issues under pressure. This experience translates into content that anticipates user problems and provides actual solutions.

No fluff, no outdated commands, no "just Google it" answers. Every tutorial is tested, every command is verified, and every configuration is production-ready.

### 3. Clear, User-Focused Writing
Technical doesn't mean complicated. I break down complex concepts into digestible steps that developers and sysadmins can follow without pulling their hair out.

### 4. SEO-Optimized Content
Technical content that ranks. I understand keyword research, meta descriptions, header hierarchy, and how to structure content for both search engines and human readers.

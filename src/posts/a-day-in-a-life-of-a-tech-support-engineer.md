When people in IT ask what I do for a living, I tell them I work in support. The response is often a raised eyebrow or a dismissive look. To those individuals: I’m proud of the work I do because it directly impacts customers' lives.

Take, for example, real-time tickets where customers urgently need their issues resolved—perhaps for a critical application required to complete international travel. Resolving such cases is incredibly satisfying.

However, support isn’t just about addressing urgent tickets. It’s not just restarting servers or following routine processes, as some might assume. Uptime may be crucial, but the job goes beyond that. There’s a sense of achievement when, for instance, a well-timed cronjob keeps a system running smoothly.

Some may scoff at the title "engineer" in "tech support engineer," but that’s the role my company has assigned me, and I stand by it. Tech support isn’t a scam like the fraudulent practices you hear about online. It’s a legitimate profession that can be as enriching or limiting as you make it.

While it may not always be the most rewarding job financially, tech support provides excellent opportunities to learn. Every ticket is a chance to deepen your knowledge of the product, its underlying technology, and the infrastructure it’s built on. Though it isn’t a specialized field, it’s a strong foundation for professional growth.

**What Does My Day Look Like?**

I review tickets submitted by clients. I analyze and investigate each ticket. These range from password resets to more complex issues like systems malfunctioning under specific conditions. Sometimes, tickets even lead to uncovering critical bugs in the backend. For complex tickets, I consult documentation and collaborate with teammates.

Debugging, especially via command-line tools, can be quite engaging.

Once the root cause of an issue is identified, it’s often escalated to the appropriate team for resolution. Clear communication is essential in these scenarios. As a support engineer, I act as a bridge, translating a client’s observations into actionable details for developers or other technical teams.

The teams involved in resolving issues might include:

- Project managers
- Frontend and backend developers
- Database administrators
- DevOps engineers
- Business analysts

When escalating a ticket, I ensure all relevant information—such as application versions, logs, and data—is included to make troubleshooting easier.

But my responsibilities don’t end with escalation. Collaboration with cross-functional teams is critical. Support engineers often absorb much of the initial workload, easing the burden on others.

Working in tech support comes with significant access to critical systems and servers, which demands a high level of responsibility. Mishandling such access could lead to serious consequences, so accountability is key.

Unfortunately, in Nepal, as I’ve experienced, starting in support can sometimes pigeonhole professionals into that role permanently. However, this doesn’t have to be the case. With persistence and effort, tech support can serve as a springboard for other career opportunities.

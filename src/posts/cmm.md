- Level-1: Initial
- Level-2: Repeatable
- Level-3: Defined
- Level-4: Quantitatively managed
- Level-5: Optimizing

In level 1, no process and project management techniques are followed. The software development activity is done mostly in an ad-hoc way. The success of a project depends upon the competence of individual developers. Once a developer leaves the company, their successor will have a hard time maintaining the code. This is mostly true for companies that are reactive rather than proactive.

In level 2, basic project management techniques along with configuration management techniques are followed for software development. The size and cost estimation is done using function point analysis, COCOMO etc. The process is followed with mutual understanding among developers but it is not documented. 

In level 3, the process is defined at the organizational level. The process is also well documented. Everyone at the organization is aware of their roles and responsibilities. However at this level, process and product metrics are not calculated.

In level 4, process and product metrics are calculated but with the intention to evalute the process only(rather than to improve the process).
Fishbone diagrams, pareto charts are used for metrics calculation.

In level 5, process and product metrics are used for continuously improving the software development process within the organization.

I have been studying full time since June 24,2025(Ashar 10,2082).

# First month 

I prioritized two subjects

- software engineering

- computer networks


I have discussed about my what I studied, resources that I used in [this](https://rbcrossley.github.io/post/self-study-computer-networks/) blog.
I will add a couple of things here for computer networks.

How satisfied am I with myself completing computer networks? Very much. I would rate it "It cannot get much better than this ,specially in such a short amount of time"

Things I want to further study related to this subject:

- Token bus, token ring, FDDI, PPP,HDLC, virtual circuit switching: frame relay, ATM, X.25, MPLS

- VLSM(Variable Length Subnet Mask) Subnetting

- Routing protocols: RIP, OSPF, BGP, IS-IS

- ICMP messages

- VoIP, FoIP; remote login protocols: telnet, ssh; traffic monitoring: MRTG, bandwidth, throughput, latency/delay

- Software-Defined Networking


**Software Engineering:**

I followed [this](https://ioesyllabus.blogspot.com/2015/05/software-engineering-ct-syllabus.html) syllabus. I am not highly satisfied with myself after completing software engineering. I could have tried harder. Thus, I am planning to learn it again if I find some spare time. Some of the concepts that I really want to learn are interrelated with other subjects. Hence while studying other subjects like Distributed Systems, I might this one. The books that I followed was "Ian Sommerville's Software Engineering". I did know about Roger S Pressman's Software Engineering, but I preferred former over the latter. I felt that Sommerville's book was very generalist. I think the nature of software engineering subject is generalist in itself. You have to study software testing, software architecture and so much more in one subject. I do not think it is possible to write a book that encompasses all of these concepts in great depth.


# Second month

I spent this month ineffectively. Specially the first fifteen days when I attempted to  study from the comfort of my home.

I was all over the place. I started with Data Structures and Discrete Mathematics. Turns out(who knew), it is good to have some programming background for learning the implementations of data structures. I was learning Java through Daniel Liang's Comprehensive Java textbook. I had not yet reached the chapter "Generics" which is crucial for understanding Data Structures concepts. Since I was adament on studying at home instead of paying for private libraries, I purchased an expensive chair for ergonomics. I only stayed a week at home before joining government owned library, Central Law Library located at Jamal, Kathmandu. 

I did some JavaFX programming here and there. Specially, solved exercises from chapter 14 of Liang's textbook. While writing this article, I was going through my journal and I noticed I was not completing anything that I put in my todo list.

I was really scattered. The government library was merely a namesake. It opened at 11AM. And closed at 7PM. The closing time was fine to me, but 11AM? Dude! Is it a library or a government office? 

 Later, I joined private library. Then I started to be effective again. Just the day before, I had started to learn about Computer Organization and Architecture. And I continued my journey. At this point, my plan was to study Computer Organization and Architecture, Computer Graphics and somehow be prepared to implement data structures in Java. While studying COA, I noticed it would be helpful to revise my digital logic fundamentals. Specially the adder, subtractor and basics of binary number systems.
 
 I started learning computer graphics as well. I completed the rasterization chapter. I revised it as well. Revision is so, so satisfying. You gain new insights from revising. I practiced "active-recall" techniques for revision. 
 
 I attempted to learn Generics in Java, but usually had a hard time internalizing those concepts. While I partially studied them, I left halfway through and went back to doing JavaFX exercises, as I had skipped those earlier to jump into generics.

I had fun for some time with JavaFX solving exercises from the textbook. Soon,however, I found myself overcommitting time on JavaFX(which is not my utmost priority); thus I decided to skip it for a few weeks.
 
 I am reading a lot of different textbooks simultaneously. But I follow only one from end to end. For COA, it is John P. Hayes. For computer graphics it is "Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice" by Foley et al. I do not think it( is possible to cover this(Computer Graphics) book end to end, though. I also have Samit Bhattacharya's Computer graphics but it is a below average book. Not worth the purchase.
 

My second month is still ongoing as of writing this article.  

**I collected some study advice to remind myself.**

- Do not wear headphones(assuming you are listening to music over it) while studying. I completely avoided bringing headphones to library. However, I allowed myself to chill once I arrived at home. The reason behind it was multi-tasking while studies decreases the efficiency. May be this varies from person to person.

- Maintain daily todo list. Make it the day before. This helps to frame your next day.

- Maintain daily log of what you did that day. It need not be a minute by minute log. When you look back at it some days later, it should not be confusing figuring out what you actually did that day.

- Switch between subjects every 2 hours. This helps for some reason. I am really bad at following this however.

- The moment you feel like I am stuck learning a concept, start a timer. For example: 90 minutes timer. Do not keep yourself stuck on that topic for longer than that the specific day. Start next day, and repeat the same thing. I am assuming you have preriquisites to study the subject. Otherwise, this would not make any sense.

- I made a rule for myself to at the library until 7PM. Even when I used to feel like "let me go home and rest", I stayed. This was really tough some days, but I pushed through. This helped mestay consistent in studying. Studying is not going to be fun every day, even if you like it. You need to push through it some days.

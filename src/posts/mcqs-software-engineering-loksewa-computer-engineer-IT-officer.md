Waterfall model
- sequential, linear approach
- each phase is completed before moving on to the next one
- requirements are gathered at the beginning of the project and changes to requirements are discouraged after the initial planning stage.

Spiral model
- iterative model+waterfall model combined
- i.e. small repeated cycles with sequential flow
- prioritizes risk analysis
- cyclical approach 
- each iteration: planning, design, build, and evaluation
- known for its focus on risk assessment and mitigation throughout the development process


Agile model
- iterative+incremental
I.e. delivering small, incremental changes to the software through iterative cycles.
- continuously evaluate requirements, plans, and result so that they can respond quickly to change.
- accommodates changing requirements throughout the development process
- self organizing teams and frequent customer interactions
- based on the concept of continuous improvement, with regular retrospectives and feedback loops
- suitable for projects where requirements are uncertain and may evolve over time

RAD(Rapid Application Development) model
- rapid development and prototyping approach
- emphasis on user feedback and involvement throughout the process
- less emphasis on specific planning. 
- need not start from scratch(CASE tools can be used to generate code)

Phases in Configuration Management process
- CM Planning
- CM Audits
- CM process execution


Functional requirements vs Non-functional requirements
Maintainability, Portability, Robustness are non-functional requirements.

Functional requirement scenario: "Consider a system where, a heat sensor detects an intrusion and alerts the security company." Here the requirement is functional.

Portability: It is a degree to which software running on one platform can easily be converted to run on another platform. It is a non-functional requirement.

Four dimensions of dependability: Availability, Reliability, Security, Safety

For managing requirements elicitation, JAD and traceability method were developed.

Technical work is not a SQA plan for a project.

Quality of conformance is the degree to which design specifications are followed in manufacturing the product.

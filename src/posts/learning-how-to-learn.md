What qualifies me to write a post about "learning how to learn"?
![](../attachments/study%20hours.jpeg)
I've spent 1000+ hours in the last 1 year "learning new things".
Why I believe this is impressive?
I had a full time job (9-6 x 5 days a week).
What did I learn?
What I learnt in 1 year can be classified into four categories:
- Programming
- Server Administration
- Computer Science
- Self-Care(I've to admit I did very less of this)
All these subjects are technical subjects. You're expected to have some tangible byproduct of learning programming and server administration. 
### Don't buy notes, guide books and non-reputed local authors' book
Learning happens through heuristic hit and trial. It doesn't happen by reading solutions. Definitely, knowing the answers to questions and the steps required to solve them will most definitely get you graduated in a degree mill university like in Nepal but that won't help you build your foundations. Getting graduated and learning are two different things in Institute of Engineer's Computer Engineering Degree.
### Pomodoro
Get a Pomodoro time app that tracks your time spent on various areas like I did. I use [milki](https://www.milki.app/).
### Find a quiet and inspirational environment
For me, it was a library or a dedicated study room cabin. I went to [bodhi](https://www.facebook.com/p/Bodhi-the-study-room-working-space-and-hostel-100063615489051/). When I am surrounded by studious people, there's no option to a human's competitive nature besides studying. 
### No such thing as learning quickly
If you're really learning new things from scratch, it takes time to build the foundations. For example: If you're completely new to programming and want to develop a working knowledge of programming at which stage you can look at a problem and frame a solution in code; it'll take you 500-1000 hours of focused learning.
I realized 1000hrs (or 1 year of average 3hrs per day) was very little time to learn something in a solid way.
### Learn by doing
In programming, you can find a textbook and solve its exercises. I won't recommend directly jumping into Leetcode as a newbie. That's best way to electrocute your learning. First, get a physical copy of programming textbook. Study the concept, solve its exercises. The avenues are great for learning programming. You can try out some bigger projects to test if you're ready or not for them.
For learning server administration, you've to "just do it". Get a Linux virtual machine. Get a good curriculum to get started with. I used [sysadmin handbook](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Linux-System-Administration-Handbook/dp/0134277554).
For computer science, it's the same. Solve exercises. Get a textbook. The next subject that I am planning to learn is "Computer Organization & Architecture" and the way I'll tackle it is by solving [patterson henesy](https://acs.pub.ro/~cpop/SMPA/Computer%20Architecture%20A%20Quantitative%20Approach%20(5th%20edition).pdf) COA book exercises. My future learning goals are [here](https://rbcrossley.github.io/post/learning-why-of-devops/).
### Make notes(digital)
I can't explain how important is making notes. Make digital notes. I use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) . You will definitely forget what you learnt 2 years ago if you don't make notes of them. I like digital notes as you can search through it. I wish I wrote digital notes while I was studying computer engineering.

I studied 2-3hrs regularly in the morning before going to office. And it went upto 9hrs per day on weekends. That's how I achieved this much.

**Future plans**
- Learning will continue no matter whatever position I achieve.
```
कार्यमित्येव यत्कर्म नियतं क्रियतेऽर्जुन।  
सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलं चैव स त्यागः सात्त्विको मतः।।18.9।।
```
- Self-care should be allocated bit more time. Something like 3hrs/week will be fine.

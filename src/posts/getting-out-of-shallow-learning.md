Shallow learning has been a huge learning disruptor for me since I got access to faster internet and no more load-shedding.

### Shallow Learning
For me it was wearing headphones while listening some music with lyrics. Or hugely outsourcing my thinking to "Google" or "youtube".
This has led to a deep lack of creativity & problem solving ability.

### How to fix?
I am planning to fix them in following ways:
- No more headphones while studying.
- If possible, I'd entirely avoid laptops, pdfs and depend more on physical textbooks.
- Doing more struggle to "deep learn".
- Setting aside some limited time to "Google" my queries that I had in the learning process.
- Become stuck on my own for at least 2 x 45 mins before giving up or outsourcing the problem to Google.

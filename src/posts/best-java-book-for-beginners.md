Are you a Computer Science student who has not yet had their 'aha' moment in programming?
Are you having trouble building logic for programs?
Do you keep totally forgetting the concepts you learnt few months ago?
Are you someone who have tried to learn programming from video courses and online tutorials and failed?
Do you also feel that programming is not your forte?

I have a book recommendation for it. This is not a list of ten book recommendations on same subject. It is just one book and I am confident it will cement your programming skills.

Why should you listen to my recommendations?
- I am not a programming guru. Instead I am still learning.
- I overcame the similar things that I described above.
- I have spent over 500 hours studying this book and solving its exercises without external assistance(AI, stackoverflow etc).

The book that I recommend is Java book by [Y Daniel Liang](https://amzn.to/48f8uwY).

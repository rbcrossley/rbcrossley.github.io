# Who this book is for?

Are you a Computer Science student who has not yet had their 'aha' moment in programming?

Are you having trouble building logic for programs?

Do you keep totally forgetting the concepts you learnt few months ago?

Are you someone who have tried to learn programming from video courses and online tutorials and failed?

Do you also feel that programming is not your forte?

If that is the case, then I have a book recommendation for you. This book is not just for specific programming language. 

Why should you listen to my recommendations?
- I am not a programming guru. Instead I am still learning. So I remember the struggles of a learner.
- I overcame the similar things that I described above.
- I have spent over 500 hours studying this book and solving its exercises without external assistance(AI, stackoverflow etc).

The book that I recommend is Java book by [Y Daniel Liang](https://amzn.to/48f8uwY).

# Do not buy this book if:

- You are considering to learn data structures.

Although this book covers implementation of various data structures, I would not recommend it to a person with sole intention of studying data structures. Instead I would supplement this book with Aaron M Tenenbaum's Data Structures book. This is because some people might feel this book is not rigorous enough for data structures.

- You have already solved many exercises from any programming book in any programming language. I say this because this book aims to teach programming. Not java. Java is merely a tool to teach programming concepts for this book.

- You are trying to learn Advanced Java this book will not be the best fit for you. I have heard good things about "Effective Java".

- You are searching for a book to teach advanced object oriented design concepts. This book scratches the surface of Object Oriented Programming. 

- You have extensive experience with any other programming language and you are transitioning to Java.

# Cost

The book is expensive but it is a book which you need to have at your study desk. I have provided the links to purchase the book.

I got the Indian edition because it is the only available book where I live. If you want better print quality, go for th international edition. The edition I got was 11th edition. I suggest getting anything >=11th edition.

Please look at the table of contents before you purchase the book. Ensure that its contents match its title.

# Why read a book at all?

In this era of vibe coding, why should you even care to read a book. That too a big fat textbook. 

AI can write code. So if your goal is just writing code and you do not want to learn to write code then you should definitely skip this book.

# Why read a programming book over youtube/udemy course?

- The threshold skills and knowledge to publish a book is still much higher compared to a course.

- The pedagogy of books is generally better than courses.

# Why read this book by Y Daniel Liang? Why not other similar books?

Well, I would not push you towards buying this book by claiming this is the best and rest are the worst. Cay Horstmann's Big Java Objects is also similar to this book. But I have not read it end to end. So I am unable to recommend it.

This book covers JavaFX, a technology that suprisingly has very few learning materials. Other java books(For example: Cay Horstman's) cover a little bit dated GUI technology, Swing.

# Why Java?

My reasons for choosing Java were:

- I had tried learning JavaScript, Python, C and C++. But they never clicked with me. And I had almost "PTSD" with those languages.

- This was the only available textbook at my local bookshop.

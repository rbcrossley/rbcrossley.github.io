[Here's](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/) the link to the official challenge. I am just starting to learn JavaFX. I am also revisiting some of the computer science principles. I do not plan to make all games of that series. I will not be regular. But I just wanted to share this to let people know that someone is also doing (dummy) game development in JavaFX, Java specially.

For discussion, [here's](https://discord.gg/VSdtQmj9NM) the discord server.

Why JavaFX? Because I was learning Java from Daniel Liang's Java textbook and it contains chapters on JavaFX. It is basically the path of least resistance for me.

Why game development?

- To apply object oriented design principles

- To apply computer science algorithms

- To internalize concepts regarding data structures and algorithms

Each of my game's source code's URL will be linked in this post itself.


I am happy to collaborate with all of you.

I am absolutely excited for this journey to begin.

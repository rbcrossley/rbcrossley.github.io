Hi, I'm Bijan,a technical content writer with hands-on Linux systems experience based in Nepal. I've spent 2+ years as an Associate Support Engineer at a fintech company, working with Linux servers, NGINX, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and debugging production issues. I write technical content that's actually accurate because I work with these systems daily. What I create: 

- Linux & DevOps tutorials 
- Setup guides 
- Troubleshooting articles 
- Technical documentation I work with SaaS companies, DevOps tools, and hosting providers who need content written by someone who understands the tech.

You can hire me on fiverr.
